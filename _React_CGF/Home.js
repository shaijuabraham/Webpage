            <h1>Innovation and Growth!!</h1>
            <p>
            American trucks, renowned for their durability and capability, have been a staple in the automotive
            industry for over a century. Beginning with the iconic Model T Runabout in 1925,
            Ford has continuously innovated, evolving from simple work vehicles to modern trucks
            that blend power, efficiency, and advanced technology. Their versatility makes them
            ideal for a wide range of uses, from personal to commercial applications. Today,
            Ford trucks like the F-Series, particularly the F-150, are celebrated for their
            robust performance, towing capacity, and being at the forefront of introducing
            features like hybrid powertrains and advanced driver-assistance systems in the truck segment.
